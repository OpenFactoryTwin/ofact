   <h1>How to model a static twin model with Excel (fast)? ðŸš€</h1>
</div>

## Introduction
The state model (twin model) describes a virtual "state" of the environment. 
The description contains immaterial objects (orders, processes, etc.) as well as material objects 
that have a physical counterpart (machines, etc.) on the shop floor.
To represent an environment as a virtual twin, a static model must be modeled in advance, 
Afterward, dynamic data from the shop floor can be integrated or simulations be executed and reach further states.
The static model can be created manually (excel, factory planner (GUI) coming soon) or learned (ML application).

The manual modeling of the static state model is complex 
and therefore requires a stringent modeling sequence in order to model correctly.
If you have not understood the state model, it is recommended to read the README related to the state model 
(twin/model/README.md). 
Here you will be familiarized with the existing classes, their use and relationships.

## General Semantics 

A step-by-step guide "How to model a static twin model with Excel?" is described below, 
but first a few general aspects of the Excel file semantics are explained.
Given this structure, the first row provides the class_name, the label and the attribute names 
("identification", "external_identifications", etc.).
For reasons of structured modeling, each Excel sheet contains only a few classes, in most cases only one.

- ***class_name***: digital twin class name (e.g., EntityType)
- ***label***: The label name is unique within the Excel file. 
  If the label is set in the attributes of an object (a row in the Excel file), 
  the object associated with the label is stored in the regarding object within the import process.
  E.g., a part (label: "gear_pa") is set in the attribute "situated_in" of a warehouse (label: "warehouse_w").  
  To know of which type an object/label is, all labels end with the short name of the class_name.
  E.g., the "EntityType" label "Verpackungsstation_et" ends up with "_et".
- ***identification***: the identification is a digital twin internal ID. If not set, 
  the identification is generated automatically in the import
- ***external_identifications***: here mappings to the physical world can be made
  (e.g., {"work_station1": ["ID xyz"], "sensor1": ["ID abc"]} 
  if the entity is named in the data_source "work_station1" as "ID xyz" and in data source "sensor1" as "ID abc")
- ***amount***: The amount attribute allows generating multiple objects (e.g., parts) with the same properties. 
  Particularly relevant for parts if you want to avoid modelling parts of the same type 
  and with the same properties several times (several lines).
  Note that all parts instantiated are, for example, stored in the resource defined in the attribute "situated_in". 
  If you want to store the part in different storages, you should model the part multiple times 
  setting different attributes/properties.

### Entry Conventions for "advanced" python objects

As the input is processed with standard libraries in the import, some conventions should be followed 
regarding the data-type of an attribute:
- list: ["Verpackungsstation_et", "Verpackungsstation_et"] (the '"' as well as the ' ' next to a '"' are important)
- dict: {"Verpackungsstation_et": 1, "Verpackungsstation1_et": 2} 
  (similar to the list, the '"' as well as the ' ' next to a key value pair is important)
- datetime_tuple: (2022, 6, 27, 12, 0) - (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) - leading zeros are not allowed

## Where to start?
It is recommended to start with the order (in the sales area).
Coming from the order: Think about what your product is?
Therefore, you should start to model the Order, the Customer, the FeatureCluster, the Features and the Part.
Within this modeling, also the EntityTypes should be set.

If you connect the digital twin to your internal IT systems, please note the following ReadME: @Adrian, link to the corresponding README

If you are using the digital twin for study purposes: In the Order tab, you can have the digital twin generate orders based on product class, start date, delivery planned date

Afterward, the main resources (warehouse, work station ...) can be set. 
This includes the setting of the 2D-Layout and the ProcessExecutionPlan.
Given the main resources, the processes are set, including the process models.
Eventually, all areas are combined and tested regarding consistency.
The modeling sequence can be summarized on the high level as follows:
1. Sales
2. Part
2. Resource
3. Time
3. Processes
4. Combination

The following nomenclature is used for standardization:

## Entity Type

**Classes:**
- ***EntityType:*** Entity types are required to categorize entities, e.g., all parts of the same type.
- ***PartType:*** An entity type that defines additionally part-specific properties such as dimensions.

**Attributes**
- ***super entity type (EntityType, EntityType):*** 
  For products that are delivered to the customer or resources that are clustered, 
  it is possible to define a super entity type. 
  Super entity types are the total group of entity_types belonging to the same super entity type.
  For example: The product is a board game consisting of game packaging, game board and game pieces. 
  The super entity type is material.
