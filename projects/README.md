# Open Factory Twin Projects

## Structure

The projects based on the ofact are located in the `projects` folder parallel to the `ofact` folder.
Each project folder contains a similar structure as the `ofact` folder (if parts used in the projects)
and is used for project-specific adaptations.
Only the models are stored in an additional folder inside the project, since here the non-code part is collected.

**Subfolder overview:**

| Area         | Component       | Brief Summary                                 |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **projects** | *template*      | an example for the digital twin usage         |
|              | *bicycle world* | Industrie 4.0 use case for a bicycle assembly |
|              | ...             | *your project specific adaptions*             |
