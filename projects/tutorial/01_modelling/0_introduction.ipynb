    "For this Open Factory Twin tutorial, we are using a simple and small system excerpt. We consider a boardgame production, where we produce a classical boardgame. This board game consists of a game board and game pieces, both of which are placed in (game) packaging. Finally, the packaging is sent to the customer with the corresponding contents.\n",

    "On this basis, we must think about how we model our customer orders. Customer orders describe in the digital twin which product is to be manufactured. For our example, this is the game packaging with contents.\n",

    "As we model our products from the business perspective (thought by the customer), we use characteristics for this. Ultimately, our product should be defined by its features. Later, we will translate these features into processes to be carried out, but we are not there yet. The characteristics are described in the sales area."
