    "## Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, value added processes and processes will be modelled, which includes models about lead times, quality, resources, transition and transformation and their relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process\n",
    "Processes are categorized into standard Process(es) and  Value Added Process(es). Value Added Processes represent the features of the orders. Processes can be transport processes or transfer processes that used as supporting processes for the value stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the system description, there are three processes: retrieving material from the buffer, packaging, and placing the finished product at the pick-up station. The distinction between Value Added Process (VAP) and Process is made by considering the properties of the VAPs. If the process is required to process a feature from the sales area this can be an indicator to be a VAP. Addtional, it should be ensured that the order is completely processable in the simulation. In our example, there is one feature: Packaging_f. The packaging of the board game is thus the first VAP. At the same time, the delivery, described as placement at the pick-up station, is also a VAP, so this process should also be modeled as a VAP. The retrieval and movement of the material is known not to be a VAP. Here, the process can be modeled as a transfer process to describe that the material was moved from another location (buffer) to the workstation. The transport process is mostly used to describe the transportation of materials. However, in the modeling of the processes, it does not matter whether the processes are described as transport or transfer. This is primarily for better orientation.\n",
    "When modeling and distinguishing between VAP and process, the notation must be observed. The **VAPs** in this example are *Packaging_vap* and *Delivery_vap*. The **process** is described as *Transferprocess_Buffer_WS_p*. The latter part serves as orientation for the origin and destination of the transfer process, but it does not affect the modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **name** can be used as already described.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **controllers** of **Lead Time**, **Transition**, **Quality** and **Transformation**, as well as **Resource**, an attribute (controller) is modeled for each. The controllers differ only in the ***suffix***, which are mentioned in the description table. For the Lead Time controller, the suffix _ptc is used. The preceding part of the label remains for better orientation. For the Transition controller, the suffix _tsc is used. For the Quality controller, the suffix _qc is used. In this case, and for simplification, no ***quality*** restrictions are considered. The same name can be used in each field to simplify modeling. ***Consider the following description: no_issue_qc***. For the Transformation controller, the suffix _tfm is used. For the Resource controller, the suffix _rc is used. In some cases it is advisible to model the process models for each processes first and try to aggregate them if possible and reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **group** is used for the later KPI insights. For this tutorial the group can be modeled as *order_et*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling of the **feature** is only required or VAPs: Since there is only one feature in the example, the same feature (*Packaging_f*) is entered for both VAPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **predecessors** will list the preceding VAPs and modeled as CNF (meaning of each tuple almost one process must be executed if a process of the tuple is required for the order). Only for the VAPs is the attribute predecessors needed. Since packaging occurs before delivery, an empty list with an empty tuple is modeled for packaging. This looks like “[()]”. For delivery, the VAP of packaging is specified: \"*[(‘Packaging_vap’)]\"*. If there are more than two VAPs, the list can contain multiple elements in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only for the VAPs is the attribute **successors** needed. The successors are modeled in contrast to the predecessors as a simple list. The approach is identical. Here, all downstream processes are listed. In the modeling form, only the list is used. This is due to the process graph, so that multiple process sequences can be considered in the simulation logic. In the boardgamefactory, the *delivery vap* is the successors of the packaging vap.\n",
