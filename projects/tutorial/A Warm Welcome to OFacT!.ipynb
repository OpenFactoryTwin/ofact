    "To illustrate the impact of this technology, let’s imagine a conversation between Ola Fact and Old Henry. Ola, an enthusiastic advocate of digital innovation, shares her insights with Henry, who represents the traditional mindset in production. Their discussion highlights the significance of digital twins and how they can revolutionize manufacturing processes.\n",

    "👩‍🔬 *Ola FacT*: Hey Henry, have you heard about digital twins?\n",
    "\n",
    "   👴 *Old Henry*: Digital twins? No, what are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍🔬 *Ola FacT*: They’re virtual replicas of physical assets, like machines or entire production lines. They allow us to handle complexities coming from demand fluctuations and individual products by simulating, monitoring, and optimizing the system in its virtual replica.\n",
    "\n",
    "   👴 *Old Henry*: That sounds impressive! This will allow me to assemble cars other than the black ones. How do they revolutionize production?\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍🔬 *Ola FacT*: By using real-time data, digital twins help predict issues before they occur, reducing downtime and improving efficiency. It’s like having a crystal ball for production!\n",
    "\n",
    "   👴 *Old Henry*: So, they enhance decision-making?\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍🔬 *Ola FacT*: Exactly! They enable better planning and testing without disrupting actual operations. It’s a game-changer for smart factories!\n",
    "\n",
    "   👴 *Old Henry*: I can see why you’re excited, Ola. This technology could really transform how we think about production!\n",
    "\n",
    "👩‍🔬 *Ola FacT*: Absolutely, Henry! The future of manufacturing is here!\n",
    "\n",
    "   👴 *Old Henry*: I'll have to take a closer look to make sure I don't miss out on my lead, Ola. Can you give me a deeper insight?\n",

    "1. 🏗️ In the **Modeling** section, you will get in touch with the board game factory and learn how to model your first state model\n",
    "([click here](01_modelling/0_introduction.ipynb)).\n",
    "   - Manually\n",
    "   - Automatically (to be implemented)\n",
    "2. 📊 Based on the state model, you can integrate dynamic event from the shop floor in the **Data Integration** part ([click here](02_data_integration/0_introduction.ipynb)).\n",
    "3. 📈 These dynamics can be analysed in the **Analytics** part by calculating key performance indicies (KPIs) to describe the performance of the shop floor system ([click here](03_analytics/0_introduction.ipynb)).\n",
