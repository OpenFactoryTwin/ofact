    "If you have skipped the modeling part, here a short introduction to the basic elements of the state model is provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orders**, **Processes** and **Entities** are the central elements of the model.\n",
    "Requests from the customers are represented as (Sales) Orders. They define the demand side for the production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entities** (parts, resources) are used to fulfill the orders with the help of processes. The **parts** represent the physical product as well as his physical components. **Resources** are used to transform entities by executing processes. They are not consumed in contrast to the parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Processes** describe the possible changes in the material flow system:\n",
    "- Transition: Spatial and logistical change (Transportation from A to B, Transfer from crate to pallet)\n",
    "- Transformation: Change of the entity (Part, Resource) due to the process (Part is screwed on, Part properties change)\n",
    "- Transform a part: Assembly, Painting, ....\n",
    "- Quality Inspection: Inspect an entity and reveal the \"real\" quality\n",
    "- Equipping a resource: Prepare production resources for the next work process\n",
    "- Quality Transformation: Change the quality of the transformed part\n",
    "In addition, processes occupy resources for defined time.\n",
