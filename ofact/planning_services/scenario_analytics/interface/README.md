# GUI Interface

Interface to the scenario analytics GUI.

Entrance point is the dashboard controller that takes the requests 
and calls the services provided by the other files to response to the requests.

The scenario_handler is used to manage the scenarios.

The api_settings are used to specify the protocol.
The settings importer handles the project-specific input.
