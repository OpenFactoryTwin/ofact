The model administration is used for both the static state model generation and 
the static state model updating in the data integration process.
Normally, the model generation is used at the beginning of the digital lifecycle and 
data integration after the initial setup. Both use the same code to set up new model objects. 
Even if the data integration is also responsible for integrating new data into the model and 
converts a static state model to a dynamic state model, also the static state model could be updated if required.
