# Community Code of Conduct

**Version 1.0
April 29, 2024**

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as community members, contributors, Committers, 
and Project Leads (collectively "Contributors") pledge to make participation in our projects and 
our community a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive and professional environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language;
- Actively encouraging all voices;
- Help others bring their perspectives and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, 
    it is essential to encourage other voices to join in;
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences;
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
- Focusing on what is best for the community;
- Showing empathy towards other community members;
- Being direct but professional; and
- Leading by example by holding yourself and others accountable

Examples of unacceptable behavior by Contributors include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery;
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances;
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;
- Public or private harassment, repeated harassment;
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission;
- Violent threats or language directed against another person;
- Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language;
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material;
- Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history;
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms;
- Excessive or unnecessary profanity;
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior; and
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Handling of violations

Reports should be directed to repository@openfactorytwin.org.
The Conduct Committee’s role is to receive and address reported violations of this Code and ensure a fair and 
speedy resolution.

Contributors who do not follow this Code in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by 
the Conduct Committee.

It’s impossible to spell out every possible scenario that might be deemed a violation of this Code. 
Instead, we rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold a high standard of integrity 
within all Open Factory Twin Spaces. Sometimes, identifying the right thing to do isn’t an easy call. 
In such a scenario, raise the issue as early as possible.
